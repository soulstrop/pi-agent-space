# pi-agent-space Architecture

**TL;DR.** pi-agent-space is a Bayesian combinatorial-optimization system that searches for high-performing **packages** — bundles of skills, prompts, workflows, foundation-model selections, and configuration values that plug into Pi's extension surface. Trials are run, scored, and persisted through pluggable **ports** in a hexagonal Python implementation under `python/src/pi_evaluator/`. A categorical paper (`docs/math.pdf`) and a Haskell DSL (`docs/architecture/haskell.md`) are precursor artifacts that informed the design, but the Python codebase is what the project actually is — the source of truth.

This document orients new readers (and LLMs) to the Python implementation. For the Haskell DSL companion and its case studies, see [`haskell.md`](haskell.md).

## A Reference Case: Claude Code

The architecture's value is making *non-standard* compositional structure explicit. Standard hex-architecture concerns (a port plus its adapters, a domain layer with no upward dependencies) are not the interesting part. The interesting part is what the categorical primitives let us compose.

The diagram below is the Claude Code workflow walked through in [`modeling-external-architectures.md`](modeling-external-architectures.md): parallel sub-agents (`Par`), context duplication (`Copy`), result merging (`MergeStrings`), and sequential composition (`Seq` / `>>>`).

    Tests --> Out([TestResult]):::io
```

The same primitives compose to express feedback loops (`ArrowLoop` — used for the "Dreaming" memory-consolidation routine) and stream tapping (`Copy` + parallel tensor — used for OpenClaw event subscription). The current Haskell DSL precursor type-checks these graphs at compile time; once the Python implementation supports multi-role packages (Phase 5+, ADR 0005), workflows like this become runnable `Package` configurations the optimizer can drive directly.

## What pi-agent-space Optimizes

The system under optimization is the pair **(Pi harness, package)**. Pi is the *builder harness* — the binary that takes a model + prompt + tool list and runs an agent loop. A **package** is the bundle of inputs that plug into Pi's extension surface: model selection, system prompt, skills (Pi tool names), and templated configuration values.

The optimizer's job: given a graduated problem suite (e.g., coding problems of increasing difficulty), find the packages on the Pareto frontier of `(tokens, dollars, scaling-slope, quality)` — and, when subjective scoring lands, on the 5D extension that includes human/LLM-judge ratings.

The framing draws on three strands:

- **Bockeler's harness layers** (model / builder / user) — Pi is the builder harness, the package's foundation-model selection is the model, and the rest of the package items constitute the *user harness* (guides + sensors). See `docs/terminology.md`.
- **Computational vs. inferential items** — items in the user harness are tagged on a 2×2 of (role: guide/sensor, type: computational/inferential). Substituting an inferential item for a computational one of the same lens shape is strictly Pareto-dominant; the optimizer can exploit a known-equivalent catalog ahead of any random move.
- **Categorical cybernetics** — the user harness wrapping a parameterized agent has the structure of a parametric lens (Capucci et al. 2021). The math paper formalizes this; ADRs 0006 and 0007 added the heteroscedastic noise commitment and the trial-outcome sum type to that formal core.

---

## Source of Truth and Precursors

A new reader should know which artifact to trust when they appear to disagree.

**Python (`python/src/pi_evaluator/`) is canonical.** It is what the optimizer actually does: trials run, scoring happens, files land on disk. Behavioral questions ("does the trial runner emit `outcome` on the finalized event?", "does the identity hash canonicalize skill order?") are answered by reading the Python and its tests.

The categorical paper (`docs/math.pdf`) and the Haskell DSL ([`haskell.md`](haskell.md)) are precursor artifacts that informed the Python's design — typed agent graphs as a strict monoidal structure, the four ports as records of functions, the user harness as a parametric lens, the trial outcome as a sum type. They continue to receive ADR-driven updates so they stay coherent with the implementation, but drift is **not** caught in real time and the Python is the resolver. If a precursor disagrees with the Python, the Python is right.

## Architecture in Layers

The Python side follows the **hexagonal** (ports-and-adapters) shape — domain at the centre, ports as the surface, adapters at the edge, orchestration on top. Four layers, no upward dependencies. The convention is documented in `docs/implementation-plan.md` and `docs/terminology.md` rather than in a dedicated ADR.

### Domain (`pi_evaluator/domain/`)

Pure data. No I/O, no third-party dependencies beyond the standard library, no framework imports. Frozen dataclasses for value types; `Trial` is the one mutable type because events accrue across phases.

- `types.py` — `Package`, `Trial`, `TrialEvent`, `Outcome`, `RawTelemetry`, `Metrics`, `SubjectiveScore`, `EvalSuiteRef`, `VersionVector`, `ValidationResult`.
- `identity.py` — `candidate_identity(...)`: a SHA-256 over a canonical JSON envelope of `(package_diff, eval_suite_ref, version_vector)` for proposer dedup. Skills are canonicalized as a sorted list before hashing (Pi treats `--tools` as order-insensitive).
- `test_suite.py` — `GraduatedProblem`, `ValidationStep`.

### Ports (`pi_evaluator/ports/`)

`typing.Protocol` definitions. The ports are the seams along which adapters plug in; they are intentionally narrow — each one expresses a single domain operation.

- `agent_harness_port.py` — run an agent against a problem.
- `scoring_port.py` — derive metrics from telemetry; ingest async subjective scores.
- `persistence_port.py` — save/append/finalize/load over the four-file trial layout.
- `eval_suite_source_port.py` — load problems from a source.

### Adapters (`pi_evaluator/adapters/`)

Concrete implementations of the ports. Stub adapters (`stub_*`) exist for Phase 1's pure pipeline; real adapters (`cli_subprocess_adapter`, `synthetic_suite_scorer`, `per_trial_directory_adapter`, `graduated_problem_set_adapter`) entered in Phase 2.

`workspace.py` is a small helper used by the CLI adapter — it copies `GraduatedProblem.workspace_dir` into a tempdir per [ADR 0004](../adrs/0004-workspace-isolation.md) so trials cannot mutate shared problem state.

### Orchestration (`pi_evaluator/trial_runner.py`)

`TrialRunner` composes the four ports into the trial pipeline:

```
configured → (eval, metric_record × M)+ → finalized
```

Per [ADR 0012](../adrs/0012-capability-profile-and-metric-events.md), each problem emits one `eval` event (carrying `exit_code`) followed by one `metric_record` event per objective metric (v1: `tokens_consumed`, `cost_dollars`, `validation_pass_rate`, `quality_score`). `TrialRunner._aggregate` rolls per-problem metrics into trial-level aggregates (sum of tokens, mean of rates). `lifecycle.classify_outcome` maps the per-trial event stream plus per-problem `RawTelemetry` to the [ADR 0007](../adrs/0007-pi-invocation-lifecycle.md) trial outcome enum (`completed`, `boundary_violation`, `error_escalated`) per ADR 0011's event-stream-first rule.

---

## Key Domain Types

### `Package`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Package:
    model: str               # "<provider>/<id>" e.g. "google/gemini-2.5-flash"
    system_prompt: str
    skills: list[str]        # set-valued; Pi's --tools is order-insensitive
    template_values: dict[str, str]
```

The variable being optimized. `skills` is set-valued at the semantic level (Pi's `--tools` flag is order-insensitive — verified against 0.74) but stored as `list[str]` for JSON-serialization stability. The candidate-identity hash sorts skills before hashing.

### `Trial` and `Outcome`

```python
@dataclass
class Trial:
    trial_id: str
    package: Package
    eval_suite_ref: EvalSuiteRef
    version_vector: VersionVector
    events: list[TrialEvent]
    final_metrics: Metrics | None
    subjective_score: SubjectiveScore | None
    outcome: Outcome | None  # ADR 0007

Outcome = Literal["completed", "boundary_violation", "error_escalated"]
```

A trial moves through phases — `configured → (eval, metric_record × M)+ → finalized` (ADR 0012) — accumulating events. The `outcome` field, set at finalize-time, is the ADR 0007 sum: a *completed* trial yielded full metrics; a *boundary_violation* trial crossed a configured boundary (timeout, cost cap) and contributes to the surrogate as a cost-cliff data point; an *error_escalated* trial is preserved for asynchronous human classification and does not feed the surrogate.

### `RawTelemetry`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class RawTelemetry:
    events: list[dict]                  # parsed Pi event stream
    exit_code: int
    validation_results: list[ValidationResult]
    stderr: str                         # captured for failure classification
    malformed_lines: list[str]          # preserved, never silently dropped
```

What the harness adapter returns. The `events` list is intentionally permissive (`list[dict]`); the scorer's coupling to specific event-schema fields (e.g., `usage.totalTokens`, `usage.cost.total`, `stopReason`) is the actual versioning surface against Pi.

### `Metrics`

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class Metrics:
    tokens_consumed: int
    validation_pass_rate: float
    quality_score: float
```

Phase 1+2 scalar shape. Per [ADR 0005](../adrs/0005-trial-cost-and-budget.md), `cost_dollars: float` will join — the Pareto frontier becomes 4D `(mean_tokens, mean_dollars, scaling_slope, mean_quality)`, becoming 5D once subjective scoring lands. Phase 4 lifts this further to a capability-profile aggregation across difficulty levels.

---

## The Four Ports

Each port is a `typing.Protocol`. Stub and real adapters satisfy each port; tests against stubs exercise the orchestration logic without touching Pi or the filesystem.

### `AgentHarnessPort`

```python
class AgentHarnessPort(Protocol):
    def run(self, package: Package, problem: GraduatedProblem,
            workspace: str) -> RawTelemetry: ...
```

The boundary between abstract package definition and concrete execution. `CliSubprocessAdapter` shells out to the real Pi binary; `StubAgentHarnessAdapter` returns canned `RawTelemetry`. Workspace materialization is an internal concern of the CLI adapter, not a separate port (see ADR 0004).

### `ScoringPort`

```python
class ScoringPort(Protocol):
    def score_objective(self, telemetry: RawTelemetry) -> Metrics: ...
    def score_subjective(self, trial: Trial) -> SubjectiveScore | None: ...
```

The two-method split mirrors the Bockeler computational/inferential distinction. `score_objective` is deterministic and runs synchronously inside the trial loop; `score_subjective` may be async and may not return a value. `SyntheticSuiteScorer` (real, derives metrics from Pi telemetry) and `StubScorer` (canned) implement the port.

### `PersistencePort`

```python
class PersistencePort(Protocol):
    def save_trial(self, trial: Trial) -> None: ...
    def append_event(self, trial_id: str, event: TrialEvent) -> None: ...
    def finalize_trial(self, trial_id: str, final_metrics: Metrics,
                       outcome: Outcome,
                       subjective_score: SubjectiveScore | None = None) -> None: ...
    def load_trials(self) -> list[Trial]: ...
```

The four-file trial directory layout per [ADR 0003](../adrs/0003-trial-persistence.md) is the contract. `PerTrialDirectoryAdapter` is the v1 implementation; an SQL backend is one of the documented reconsider triggers.

### `EvalSuiteSourcePort`

```python
class EvalSuiteSourcePort(Protocol):
    def load(self) -> list[GraduatedProblem]: ...
```

Loading the problem set is at the I/O edge; once loaded, the suite is just data that flows into `TrialRunner`. `GraduatedProblemSetAdapter` reads a directory of `problem.json` files; the workspace path is resolved to the on-disk problem directory.

---

## Trial Persistence Layout

Each closed trial sits in `trials/{trial_id}/` with four files (per ADR 0003):

| File | Contents | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `config.json` | `trial_id`, `package`, `eval_suite_ref` | What was proposed |
| `versions.json` | `pi_version`, `package_versions`, `eval_suite_version` | Frozen-at-trial-start version snapshot |
| `events.jsonl` | One event per line: `{phase, timestamp, payload}` | Phase-by-phase trial trace |
| `final.json` | `metrics`, `outcome`, `subjective_score` | Trial close-out |

`config.json` and `versions.json` answer different questions about a trial — what we proposed vs. what was actually frozen — and stay separate so the version vector is independently greppable across trials. `events.jsonl` is append-only during the trial lifecycle; `final.json` is written atomically (write-temp + rename) at trial close.

---

## Precursor: The Categorical Paper

File: `docs/math.tex` (built to `docs/math.pdf`).

The paper formalizes the same structure as a strict monoidal category:

- **Section II** — agent workflows as morphisms in a monoidal category, composition and routing primitives, advanced control (choices, loops, parameterized morphisms via Para).
- **Section III** — the case studies as morphism diagrams.
- **Section IV** — Pareto frontier evaluation; surrogate modeling and acquisition. Post-ADR-0006, `predictPerformance` returns both conditional mean and input-dependent variance (heteroscedastic GP); below the bootstrap threshold, acquisition reverts to pure exploration.
- **Appendix A** — user-harness feedback as a parametric lens (Capucci et al. 2021), the computational/inferential typing and the substitution principle, partial/asynchronous feedback as an affine traversal, and (post-ADR-0007) the trial-outcome sum type with its metric-bearing projection π : Outcome → Maybe(Metrics).

The paper is a reading aid and a discipline. It does not run anything.
